# CLAUDE.md

**Agor** — Multiplayer canvas for orchestrating Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini sessions.

Manage git worktrees, track AI conversations, visualize work on spatial boards, and collaborate in real-time.

---

## IMPORTANT: Context-Driven Development

**This file is intentionally high-level.** Detailed documentation lives in `context/`.

**When working on a task, you are EXPECTED to:**

1. Read the relevant `context/` docs based on your task (see index below)
2. Fetch on-demand rather than trying to hold everything in context
3. Start with `context/README.md` if unsure where to look

**The `context/` folder is the source of truth.** Use CLAUDE.md as a map, not a manual.

---

## Quick Start

**Simplified 2-process workflow:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Daemon (watches core + daemon, auto-restarts)
cd apps/agor-daemon
pnpm dev

# Terminal 2: UI dev server
cd apps/agor-ui
pnpm dev
```

**IMPORTANT FOR AGENTS:**

- User runs dev environment in watch mode (daemon + UI)
- **DO NOT run `pnpm build`** or compilation commands unless explicitly asked
- **DO NOT start background processes** - user manages these
- Focus on code edits; watch mode handles recompilation automatically

## Core Primitives

Agor is built on 5 primitives:

1. **Session** - Container for agent conversations with genealogy (fork/spawn)
2. **Task** - User prompts as first-class work units
3. **Worktree** - Git worktrees with isolated environments (PRIMARY UNIT ON BOARDS)
4. **Report** - Markdown summaries generated after task completion
5. **Concept** - Modular context files (like this one!)

**For details:** Read `context/concepts/core.md`

## Development Patterns

### Code Standards

1. **Type-driven** - Use branded types for IDs, strict TypeScript
2. **Centralize types** - ALWAYS import from `packages/core/src/types/` (never redefine)
3. **Read before edit** - Always read files before modifying
4. **Prefer Edit over Write** - Modify existing files when possible
5. **Git operations** - ALWAYS use `simple-git` (NEVER subprocess `execSync`, `spawn`, etc.)
6. **Error handling** - Clean user-facing errors, no stacktraces in CLI

### Important Rules

**Git Commits:**

- ❌ **NEVER use `git commit --no-verify`** without explicit user permission
- Pre-commit hooks (typecheck, lint) exist for a reason
- If hooks fail, fix the issues - don't bypass them
- Only bypass hooks if user explicitly says "skip hooks" or "use --no-verify"

**Git Library:**

- ✅ Use `simple-git` for ALL git operations
- ❌ NEVER use `execSync`, `spawn`, or bash for git commands
- Location: `packages/core/src/git/index.ts`

**Watch Mode:**

- User runs `pnpm dev` in daemon (watches core + daemon)
- **DO NOT** run builds unless explicitly asked or you see compilation errors
- **DO NOT** start background processes

**Type Reuse:**

- Import types from `packages/core/src/types/`
- Sessions, Tasks, Worktrees, Messages, Repos, Boards, Users, etc.
- Never redefine canonical types

**Worktree-Centric Architecture:**

- Boards display **Worktrees** as primary cards (NOT Sessions)
- Sessions reference worktrees via required FK
- Read `context/concepts/worktrees.md` before touching boards

---

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Feature

1. Read relevant `context/` docs first (see index above)
2. Check `context/concepts/models.md` for data models
3. Update types in `packages/core/src/types/`
4. Add repository layer in `packages/core/src/db/repositories/`
5. Create service in `apps/agor-daemon/src/services/`
6. Register in `apps/agor-daemon/src/index.ts`
7. Add CLI command in `apps/agor-cli/src/commands/` (if needed)
8. Add UI component in `apps/agor-ui/src/components/` (if needed)

### Testing

```bash
# Database operations
sqlite3 ~/.agor/agor.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages"

# Daemon health
curl http://localhost:3030/health

# CLI commands (ensure clean exit, no hanging)
pnpm -w agor session list
pnpm -w agor repo list
```

## Feature Flags

### Worktree RBAC (`execution.worktree_rbac`)

**Default: `false`** (disabled for backward compatibility)

Controls the worktree Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Unix group isolation system.

**When enabled (`execution.worktree_rbac: true`)**:

- ✅ Enforces permission checks on all worktree operations
- ✅ Worktree owners service (`/worktrees/:id/owners`) is registered
- ✅ Unix integration service creates groups for worktree isolation
- ✅ Permission levels: `view` / `prompt` / `all` (see `context/guides/rbac-and-unix-isolation.md`)
- ✅ UI displays Owners & Permissions section in WorktreeModal

**When disabled (default)**:

- ✅ Open access - all authenticated users can access all worktrees
- ✅ No permission enforcement on worktrees, sessions, tasks, or messages
- ✅ Worktree owners service not registered (404 on API calls)
- ✅ No Unix group creation
- ✅ UI automatically hides Owners & Permissions section

**Configuration**:

```yaml
# ~/.agor/config.yaml
execution:
  worktree_rbac: false # Default: disabled
  unix_user_mode: simple # Options: simple, insulated, strict
```

**Implementation notes**:

- Database schema (worktree_owners table, others_can column) exists regardless of flag state
- Migrations run on all instances (schema changes are permanent)
- Toggling flag does NOT clean up existing Unix groups or ownership data
- Safe to enable/disable at runtime - degrades gracefully in both directions

**Related docs**: `context/guides/rbac-and-unix-isolation.md`, `context/explorations/unix-user-modes.md`

## Extended Thinking Mode

**New in January 2025**: Agor now supports Claude's extended thinking mode with automatic keyword detection!

### What is Extended Thinking?

Extended thinking allocates additional tokens for Claude to use an internal "scratchpad" to reason through problems before generating responses. Great for complex coding tasks, architecture decisions, and refactoring.

### Usage

**Auto Mode (Default)** - Automatically detects keywords in your prompts:

- `think` → 4,000 tokens
- `think hard`, `think deeply` → 10,000 tokens
- `think harder`, `ultrathink` → 31,999 tokens

```bash
# Example prompts
"please think about the best architecture for this feature"
"think hard about potential edge cases"
"ultrathink this critical migration strategy"
```

**Manual Mode** - Set explicit token budget in session settings (0-32k)

**Off Mode** - Disable thinking to save costs

### Implementation

- **Keyword Detection**: `packages/core/src/tools/claude/thinking-detector.ts`
- **SDK Integration**: `packages/core/src/tools/claude/query-builder.ts`
- **Message Processing**: `packages/core/src/tools/claude/message-processor.ts`
- **Design Doc**: `context/explorations/thinking-mode.md`

Thinking blocks appear in messages as separate content blocks and stream in real-time via WebSocket (`thinking:chunk` events).

## Tech Stack

**Backend:**

- FeathersJS - REST + WebSocket API
- Drizzle ORM - Type-safe database layer
- LibSQL - SQLite-compatible database
- simple-git - Git operations

**Frontend:**

- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Ant Design - Component library (dark mode, token-based styling)
- React Flow - Canvas visualization
- Storybook - Component development

**CLI:**

- oclif - CLI framework
- chalk - Terminal colors

---

## Configuration

Agor uses `~/.agor/config.yaml` for persistent configuration.

```bash
# Set daemon port
pnpm agor config set daemon.port 4000

# Set UI port
pnpm agor config set ui.port 5174
```

**Environment Variables:**

- `PORT` - Daemon port override
- `VITE_DAEMON_URL` - Full daemon URL for UI
- `VITE_DAEMON_PORT` - Daemon port for UI

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Method is not a function" after editing @agor/core

**Should NOT happen** with new 2-process workflow (daemon watches core and auto-restarts).

**If it still happens:**

```bash
cd packages/core && pnpm build
cd apps/agor-daemon && pnpm dev
```

### tsx watch not picking up changes

```bash
cd apps/agor-daemon
rm -rf node_modules/.tsx
# Restart daemon
```

### Daemon hanging

```bash
lsof -ti:3030 | xargs kill -9
cd apps/agor-daemon && pnpm dev
```

---

## Key Files

**Configuration:**

- `~/.agor/config.yaml` - User configuration
- `~/.agor/agor.db` - SQLite database

**Important Paths:**

- `packages/core/src/types/` - Canonical type definitions
- `packages/core/src/db/schema.ts` - Database schema
- `apps/agor-daemon/src/services/` - FeathersJS services
- `context/concepts/` - Architecture documentation

---

## Remember

📚 **Context docs are the source of truth** - fetch on-demand based on your task
🔍 **Start with `context/README.md`** - complete index of all concepts
⚠️ **Read `worktrees.md` before touching boards** - fundamental architecture shift
🚫 **Never use subprocess for git** - always use `simple-git`
✨ **Watch mode is running** - don't build unless explicitly asked
